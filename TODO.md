# TODO: Optimize AI Analysis Performance

## Current Issues
- AI analysis takes too long due to multiple concurrent API calls (analyzeCode, getRefactoringSuggestions, getCodeSuggestions)
- Long prompts may be causing slower responses
- No caching of results for repeated analyses
- Rate limiting (10 requests/hour) can be hit quickly with multiple calls

## Optimization Tasks
- [x] Analyze current performance bottlenecks in GeminiService and SnippetAnalysisPanel
- [x] Optimize prompts to be more concise while maintaining analysis quality
- [x] Consider combining multiple analysis types into fewer API calls (e.g., single call for all analyses)
- [x] Implement result caching to avoid redundant API calls for same code
- [ ] Add progress indicators for partial results during analysis (not needed with single call)
- [x] Refactor code without breaking existing functionality or changing the model
- [x] Test optimizations to ensure no regressions in analysis quality

## Implementation Plan
1. Review current implementation in geminiService.ts and SnippetAnalysisPanel.tsx
2. Identify specific slow points (prompt length, concurrent calls, etc.)
3. Create optimized version with combined prompts and caching
4. Update UI to show progress and handle partial results
5. Test thoroughly to ensure no breaking changes
